    the need for WSGI-style header conversion at request time.

    This class accepts natural header names (e.g., "X-Forwarded-For") and
    handles the conversion to ipware's expected format internally.

    Example:
        >>> from fastapi_ipware import FastAPIIpWare
        >>> ipware = FastAPIIpWare()
        >>> ip, trusted = ipware.get_client_ip_from_request(request)
